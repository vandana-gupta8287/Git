> ## **A.9.Client Data Segregation at Account Level (Major Change)**

### ***Introduction***

We have implemented a significant change in Workmateâ€™s database by segregating the Client Master Table at the account level. Previously, all client data was stored in a single master table, which contained clients from all accounts. With this update, each account now has its own dedicated client table, improving the overall performance and efficiency of the platform.

### ***Key Features & Benefits***

**Faster Client Searches:** By segregating client data at the account level, the search process becomes significantly faster, as the system no longer needs to query a large, centralized table containing data for all accounts.

**Improved Database Performance:** Segregating client data reduces the load on the database, leading to better performance for other operations that rely on client data, such as reporting, filtering, and task assignments.

**Enhanced Data Security:** Each accountâ€™s client data is now more securely isolated, reducing the risk of cross-account data exposure and improving overall data governance.

**Simplified Data Management:** This change simplifies data management tasks such as updates, backups, and data restoration, as each accountâ€™s client data can be handled independently.

**Scalability:** With client data separated per account, the system can now scale more effectively. As the number of accounts and clients grows, this structure allows for smoother operations without performance bottlenecks.

**More Efficient Resource Usage:** Segregated tables allow more efficient use of database resources, improving query processing times and optimizing performance for high-volume operations.

### ***Conclusion***

The Client Data Segregation at Account Level is a major architectural improvement that boosts performance, security, and scalability. With faster searches and improved database management, this change enhances the overall user experience, particularly for organizations handling large volumes of client data.
